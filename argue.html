    <p>The <strong>Environmental Movement</strong> was more important than the Chicano Movement. The first reason why the <strong>Environmental Movement</strong> was more important than the Chicano Movement is that the <strong>Environmental Movement</strong> can help a wide variety of issues around the world. According to the Academic Kids Encyclopedia, “<strong>Environmental Movement</strong> is a term often used for any social or political movement directed towards the preservation, restoration, or enhancement of the natural environment.” (Academic Kids Encyclopedia 2023). This piece of evidence shows that the <strong>Environmental Movement</strong> is more important because it relates to broader topics that affect the world we live in compared to the Chicano Movement, which fought more specific topics. Another reason why the <strong>Environmental Movement</strong> is more important than the Chicano Movement is that taking care of our planet is very important for our health. For example, without a well-sustained planet, we would all be suffering. Some examples of problems we could face without taking care of the earth are drought, food shortages, rising waters, and more natural disasters. While on the other hand, the Chicano Movement is fighting for agricultural rights, which depend on how healthy the Earth is to be sustained. The last reason why <strong>Environmental Movement</strong> is more important than the Chicano Movement is that the <strong>Environmental Movement</strong> protects many valuable assets that we need in our lives. Some examples of daily necessities we need that the <strong>Environmental Movement</strong> protects are our oceans, crops, and most of our natural resources. Some might say that the Chicano Movement is more important because it protects agricultural rights. I do agree that it is important to protect agricultural rights, but without the earth, none of that would be possible. Due to how broad the <strong>Environmental Movement</strong> is it can cover more topics and show light to more problems in the world. For instance, there were a lot of administrations and organizations that were made due to the <strong>Environmental Movement</strong> that brought many helpful changes to the world and protected many habitats that are important to the world. That is why <strong>Environmental Movement</strong> is more important than the Chicano Movement.</p>
