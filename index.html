    <p>The Environmental Movement was more important than the Chicano Movement. First reason why the Environmental Movement was more important than the Chicano Movement because the Environmental Movement can help a wide variety of issues around the world as said by Academic Kids Encyclopedia “Environmental Movement is a term often used for any social or political movement directed towards the preservation, restoration, or enhancement of the natural environment.” (Academic Kids Encyclopedia 2023). This piece of evidence shows that the Environmental Movement is more important because it can cause broader topics that affect the world we live in more compared to the Chicano Movement which fought more specific topics. Another reason why the Environmental Movement is more important than the Chicano Movement is because taking care of our planet is very important for our health. For example, without a well sustained planet we would all be suffering. Some examples of problems we could face without taking care of Earth are drought, food shortages, rising waters, and more natural disasters. While on the other hand Chicano Movement is fighting for agricultural rights, which depends on how healthy the Earth is to be sustained well. Last reason why Environmental Movement is more important than the Chicano Movement is because the Environmental Movement protects many valuable assets that we need in our lives. Some examples of daily necessities we need that the Environmental Movement protects is our ocean, crops, and most of our natural resources. Some might say that the Chicano Movement is more important because it protects agricultural rights, I do agree that it is important to protect agricultural rights but without the Earth none of that would be possible and also due to how broad the Environmental Movement is it can cover broader topics and show light to more problems in the world. For instance, there were lots of Administrations and Organizations that were made due to the Environmental Movement that brought many helpful changes to the world and protected many habitats that are important to the world. That is why Environmental Movement is more important than the Chicano Movement.</p>
