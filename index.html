    <p>This movement started when US Senator Gaylord Nelson hired Denis Hays to do national teach-in about environmental issues. This was also the beginning of the first plans for Earth Day.  With success the first national Earth Day was celebrated on April 22nd 1970 with over 20 million people participating around the world. After what US Senator Gaylord Nelson did and Denis Hay's teachings, many events centered around the Environmental Movement started to occur, like new Acts, Organizations, Rules, & Bans were created. Some examples are the Endangered Species Act, Clean Water Act, Department Of Energy, and many more. This social issue will keep impacting society because it helps the Earth in many ways like protecting forests, protecting endangered species, and keeping us in a safe environment. These are some long term effects on how the  Environmental Movement can protect the world we live in. One of the biggest impacts the Environmental Movement has done to this day is the creation of Earth Day. This is now an annual national holiday celebrated by people around the world with a goal to make the Earth a better place.</p>
